        <p>Developers might want to use the option "Load a plugin" to manually load their plugin. The developers documentation describes how to add a plugin to the automatic loading procedure.</p>
        <p>In OpendTect, there are several <a href="https://dgbes.com/index.php/software/plugins" target="_blank">commercial plugins</a> available. Each plugin adds extra functionality to OpendTect. To load a new plugin, browse to the appropriate file. More information on plugin design is available in the <i>Programmer manual</i>.</p>
